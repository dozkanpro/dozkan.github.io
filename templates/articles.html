                        <h2><a href="https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/tezSorguSonucYeni.jsp"> Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis in Turkish.</a></h2>
                        <p><b>Abstract:</b>
                           : Most customers rely on reviews and comments of other consumers that already purchased and used the products that they intend to purchase. As the sharing opinions and preferences of people on online platforms are widespread, these huge data sources are highly valuable to companies to gather feedback on their products. Therefore, researchers have an essential data mining goal to extract useful information from sentiments. In this thesis, the aim is to perform an aspect-based analysis to determine the sentiment polarity of the reviews for a smart phone using natural language processing techniques in Turkish for the performance, price and camera aspects. The techniques used are data preprocessing, explicit and implicit feature extraction as well as grouping corresponding aspects and lexicon-based sentiment analysis at word-level and word-group level. The evaluations show that the highest values of precision, recall and f1 measure for the aspects examined are found to be 93%, 94% and 93%, respectively. These results reveal that our study has remarkable performance compared to other Turkish aspect-based sentiment analysis studies.</p>
